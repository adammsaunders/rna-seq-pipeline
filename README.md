# rna-seq-pipeline
Collaboration between UO BGMP and NemaMetrix Inc.


The goal of the tool is to generate a report describing differential gene expression statistics. 
The purpose of this analysis tool is to provide NemaMetrix with the capacity to analyze raw RNA-seq reads for differential gene expression.
Additionally, this package can be used to validate library prep and sequencing assays.
